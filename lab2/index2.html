        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <p>My name is Jasmin Vega. I am an AGPM major and I live and work
            in San Jose. My only platform for gameplaying is currently
            my switch but I'd love to have the space and money to build
            my own PC. I like watching and reading content related to true crime.
            I have two dogs, a dachshund named Scrappy Doo and a
            chihuahua named Mamas, I would identify them as my furry babies. 
           <p>My partner Em is also an AGPM major and currently likes to play
            Baldur's Gate 3 and TFT. They are also really inloved in dance teams
            alongside doing their studies at UCSC! She also has pets!! With two cats 
            named Mariko and Momo, and a dog named Kiko.</p>
