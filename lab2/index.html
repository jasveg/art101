					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The main challenge of this lab was to figure out making our own
						webpage with HTML. After creating a plain website with HTML the 
						next challenge was to create a website that has character and customizations
						with color, borders, and text with information about ourselves and our partner.
					</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Initially, my main problem was figuring out how to create a plain HTML website 
						because there was no class due to the poweroutage. After utilizing the sources
						Prof Wes provided in the modules with introduction to HTML it became much easier. It
						wasn't required but I really wanted to add a picture of myself from my photo album 
						and it was kind of difficult but with some video watching and finessing I was able to accomplish
						what I set out to do. I also had a real struggle with adding a colored border
						to my website in CSS, but I think I was overcomplicating it but I took a 
						break and figured it out.  
					</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I put a good amount of effort into this lab assignment and am really happy with how 
						it has turned out so far. I'm excited to learn more features as I learn more about HTML 
						and CSS. My current lab 2 has lots of color and I was also able to add a picture of 
						myself which I was really excited to have figured out! I'm especially happy with my lab 2
						work at the moment because the style and content came out how I had hoped. 
					</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> Em and I both succesfully created websites that fulfilled our own aesthetics!</p>
