			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge for this lab was being able to effectively organize 
						our files so that material was easier to locate.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some initial issue of being able to link the lab content to my 
						homepage because it kept taking me to my overall ART101 folder and not directly
						to each selected lab. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Prior to this lab my organization was already pretty well done, but being
						able to link the labs to my mainpage makes it much more aesthetically pleasing
					as well as easier to navigate.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> The results can be seen through my screenshots as well as through the links on my 
						page! Here is the file structure I created! 
					</p>
